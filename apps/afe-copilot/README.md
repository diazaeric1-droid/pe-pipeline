# AFE Copilot

> An open-source AI system that drafts AFEs in 5 minutes, tracks the approval pipeline, and analyzes post-execution variance — built for operators running multi-rig workover programs.

Built by a Staff Production Engineer (ex-OXY, ex-Shell) who has written hundreds of AFEs by hand.

## The problem

An operator running 11 workover rigs generates ~200 AFEs per year. Each AFE consumes 1–3 hours of engineer time on writing, routing, and follow-up — that's 400–600 hours per year spent on paperwork that doesn't make a single barrel of oil. AFEs that should be approved in a week sit for a month waiting on missing line items, unclear cost justification, or a reviewer asking the same question for the fifth time.

This system attacks all three bottlenecks: drafting speed, drafting quality, and pipeline visibility.

## What it does

**1. AFE Drafter agent**
Input: well diagnosis + intervention choice (e.g., "ESP swap + acid stim on well ED-001H").
Output: a polished .docx AFE with:
- Scope of work and technical justification
- Line-item cost breakdown benchmarked against the cost DB, split **tangible (capex) vs. intangible (IDC)** for the tax view
- Economics with a **true effective-10% discount**, plus **working-interest / NRI net NPV**, a **price-deck sensitivity** strip, and a **JIB partner-allocation** preview
- Risk register with mitigation actions
- Approval signature block, with the AFE auto-routed to the **required approver** by delegation-of-authority $ limits

**2. AFE Pipeline Tracker**
Live dashboard showing every in-flight AFE with status (draft → engineering review → finance → approved → executed), aging in days, predicted next-bottleneck, the **required approver** for its $ value, and an **immutable audit trail** of every status change.

**3. Variance Analyzer**
Post-execution: ingest actuals and compute actual-vs-AFE variance by category — ranked by **$ overrun** (so 100%-unbudgeted lines are surfaced, not hidden), with **AFE-supplement flags** when an AFE overruns the policy threshold (>10%).

**See a real sample:** [`examples/sample_afe_acid_stimulation.md`](examples/sample_afe_acid_stimulation.md) — a complete agent-generated AFE for a synthetic Delaware Basin acid stimulation, including scope, technical justification, cost breakdown with vendor benchmarks, NPV/payout, and a 7-line risk register (5 standard + 2 well-specific).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/afe-copilot
cd afe-copilot
pip install -e ".[docs]"
cp .env.example .env  # add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Draft an AFE from a well-diagnosis JSON
python -m src.drafter --input examples/well_diagnosis_001.json --out drafts/

# Open the pipeline tracker
streamlit run demo/app.py
```

## Roadmap

- [x] v0.1 — AFE Drafter agent producing valid .docx
- [x] v0.2 — Cost DB with historical benchmarks (synthetic)
- [x] v0.3 — Pipeline Tracker + Streamlit dashboard; Monte-Carlo economics; validated chain from Project 1
- [x] v0.4 — Variance Analyzer wired in (unbudgeted + supplement flags); WI/NRI net economics + JIB; tangible/intangible (IDC) split; authority-limit routing; immutable audit trail; effective-10% discount fix
- [ ] v0.5 — Real cost-DB backend (SAP/Quorum/Oracle) replacing synthetic benchmarks; offset-AFE percentile comparison
- [ ] v0.6 — Routing prediction model: which AFEs will bottleneck where, by historical pattern

## Why this matters for the AI-engineering hiring conversation

This isn't a toy. It addresses a problem hiring managers have explicitly flagged as a gap they can't fill — production engineers who can scale beyond what a single human can write in a week. Combined with the Production Engineer Copilot, it's a complete end-to-end workflow: well diagnosis → intervention selection → AFE draft → approval tracking → variance analysis.

## Part of a multi-agent pipeline

This is the **authorize** stage of a detect → predict → authorize chain: the
[Daily Production Digest](../daily-production-digest) flags a pump-failure signature,
the [ESP Failure-Risk Agent](../esp-failure-risk-agent) scores it and emits a diagnosis,
and this app drafts the AFE. `python -m src.handoff --input diagnosis.json` renders a
complete, decision-ready AFE **deterministically** (no API key) — cost split, net
economics, risk register, authority routing — or `--llm` for the Claude narrative. See
[`../pe-pipeline/PIPELINE.md`](../pe-pipeline/PIPELINE.md); run the whole chain with `python3 ../pe-pipeline/pe_chain.py`.
